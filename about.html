	<span class="title">About</span>
	My research focuses on computational biology, bioinformatics and software development
	applied to both systems and synthetic biology. My work covers genome-scale and kinetic
	metabolic modelling, synthetic DNA design, enzyme engineering, and 'omics data analysis,
	management and integration.
	<p>
	With degrees in chemistry and computing science, a PhD in computational systems biology
	and experience in both industrial and academic environments, I have over 20 years of
	interdisciplinary experience in software engineering, researching and developing computational
	approaches to solving biological problems.
